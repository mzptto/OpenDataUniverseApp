# Move OSDU Data Explorer to AWS - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the migration of the OSDU Data Explorer from localhost to a fully deployed AWS web application with proper authentication, scalability, and security.

## Architecture Decision
**Recommended Approach**: Serverless architecture using AWS Amplify + API Gateway + Lambda
- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify (React app hosting)
- **Backend**: API Gateway + Lambda functions (replacing Express server)
- **App Authentication**: NEW AWS Cognito User Pool for app access control
- **External Data Auth**: Existing .env credentials for OSDU API access
- **Storage**: S3 for static assets, DynamoDB for session/cache data

## Authentication Architecture

### Two-Layer Authentication System
1. **App Layer Authentication** (NEW - to be created)
   - AWS Cognito User Pool for app users (employees, contractors, etc.)
   - Controls who can access the OSDU Data Explorer application
   - User roles: Admin, Power User, Viewer
   - Sign-up/Sign-in flows with email verification

2. **Data Layer Authentication** (EXISTING - from .env)
   - OSDU API credentials for accessing external data sources
   - Stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Used by Lambda functions to fetch OSDU data
   - Token refresh handled automatically

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs into app ‚Üí Cognito User Pool validates ‚Üí JWT token issued
2. Frontend sends requests with JWT ‚Üí API Gateway validates ‚Üí Lambda executes
3. Lambda uses stored OSDU credentials ‚Üí Fetches data from OSDU APIs ‚Üí Returns to user

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Admin**: Full access, user management, system configuration
- **Power User**: Full data access, can modify views and exports
